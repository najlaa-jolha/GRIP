# GRIP
GRIP Data Science and Business Analytics assignments
This repository contains GRIP tasks:
1st GRIP task is about a regression model trained to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours they spent studying. It aims to provide insights into the relationship between study time and academic performance.

Key Features:

1-Linear regression model using scikit-learn 
2-Clean and modular code organization
3-Detailed performance evaluation metrics
4-Data visualization (optional, if applicable)
5-Easy deployment options (optional, if applicable)
6-Clear instructions for usage and contribution

Requirements:
1-Python 3.x
2-NumPy
3-pandas
4-scikit-learn
5-Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


2nd GRIP task is about  predicting and visualizing clusters in the Iris dataset: An Unsupervised Exploration

Description:

This repository implements an unsupervised approach to explore the inherent structure of the Iris dataset, a classic benchmark for machine learning tasks. The model aims to:

Predict the optimal number of clusters: Utilizes  elbow method to determine the most suitable number of clusters (k) that capture meaningful groupings within the data.
Visualize the clusters effectively: Employs clear and informative visualizations to depict the identified clusters using their features.
